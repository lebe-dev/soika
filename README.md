# soika

**soika** is a lightweight, Sentry-compatible error tracking system written in
Rust. It is designed from the ground up for minimal resource consumption and
high throughput.

**Status:** work in progress.

- **Drop-in ingestion** for the modern Sentry SDK envelope protocol.
- Captures, groups, and displays **errors/exceptions and messages** with full
  **stacktraces** (Go, Rust, Svelte/JS, and any Sentry-compatible SDK).
- A complete, self-contained web UI for triaging issues.
- Ships as a **single binary** with the frontend embedded, plus a minimal
  Alpine container image — no Redis, no broker, no separate worker.
